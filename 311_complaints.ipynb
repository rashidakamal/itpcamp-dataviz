    "New York City is a wonderful place full of go-getting nerds who love to complain! The [NYC Open Data Portal](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/) makes all of this beautiful, beautiful angst available to our prying eyes. To get us started, I downloaded about [11 GB csv](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Social-Services/311-Service-Requests-from-2010-to-Present/erm2-nwe9) of 311 data from 2010 to now. That's just too much data for us right now, so I decided to filter that data down to just **December 2018**. That's only ~200k complaints (lol). \n",

    "I did this using a set of command line tools called `csvkit`. We won't cover that here, but just for your reference, here is what I did to filter the data:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Install csvkit: `pip3 install csvkit`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Check out the first 5 rows of my 311 csv file: `head -n 5 311_Service_Requests_from_2010_to_Present.csv`\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Use the \"csvgrep\" command to filter the \"Created Date\" column by a regular expression representing December 2018 & save it to a new csv called \"december-2018.csv\":   `csvgrep --columns Created\\ Date --regex \"12\\/\\d{2}\\/2018.+\" 311_Service_Requests_from_2010_to_Present.csv > december-2018.csv`\n",
